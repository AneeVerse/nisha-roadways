# SOLAR PANEL & PARTS TRANSPORTATION

## **Specialized Solar Transportation**

We launched our dedicated solar transportation team two years ago to support India's renewable energy growth. We move solar panels from ports, warehouses, and manufacturing units across India.

## **Why Solar Cargo Needs Specialists**

Our team understands **proper stacking, securing methods, and road conditions** that affect solar cargo. We've trained drivers specifically for this cargo type.

## **Equipment We Use**

**Container vehicles:**

* 40-foot container vehicles for maximum protection

* 20-foot container vehicles for smaller loads

**Open trailers:**

* Designed for solar panel loading

* Proper lashing points to prevent movement

* Tarpaulin coverage for weather protection

## **What We Transport**

* Solar panels (imported and domestic)

* Solar inverters

* Mounting structures

* Battery storage systems

* Other solar installation equipment

## **Our Process**

1. Pre-loading inspection of vehicle/container

2. Proper floor padding installation

3. Systematic panel stacking with separators

4. Professional lashing to prevent shifting

5. Tarpaulin coverage (for open trailers)

6. GPS tracking throughout journey

7. Careful offloading at destination

## **From Where to Where**

**From ports:**  
 Mundra, JNPT, Chennai, and other ports where solar equipment arrives.

**From warehouses:**  
 CFS and private warehouses storing imported panels.

**From manufacturers:**  
 Domestic solar manufacturing units across India.

**To sites:**  
 Solar farms, rooftop installation sites, distributor warehouses.

## **Insurance**

We recommend insurance for all solar cargo. Coverage available based on invoice value or declared value.

 Based on cargo dimensions and weight, we recommend the right trailer type. We explain why one trailer works better than another.

**Permission assistance:**  
 RTO permissions, traffic police clearances, state border permits—we help with all paperwork. We know which authorities to contact.

**Escort services:**  
 Police escorts, pilot vehicles, gunmen (for high-value ODC)—available based on route requirements.

**Long distances:**  
 When road transport becomes expensive due to distance.

## **How It Works**

1. You share cargo details and quantity

2. We check rail availability for your route

3. We book rail space and arrange wagon allocation

**Regular small shipments:**  
 Weekly or monthly shipments of 100-500 kg.

**E-commerce fulfillment:**  
 Sending inventory to regional warehouses.

## **Quantity Range**

From **1 kg to 20 kg and beyond**. No minimum or maximum limits—you pay for what you ship.

## **How It Works**

1. You share cargo details (weight, dimensions, destination)

2. We calculate volumetric weight

3. You pay for actual weight or volumetric weight (whichever is higher)

4. We consolidate your cargo with others going to the same location

5. GPS tracking throughout journey

6. Delivery to your destination

7. You receive only your cargo with proper documentation

## **Pricing**

You pay based on:

* **Actual weight** (in kg)

* **Volumetric weight** (length × width × height ÷ 5000\)

* Destination zone

* Service type (standard or express)

## **Vehicle Types**

* **Trucks** for consolidated road transport

* **Containers** for containerized LCL consolidation

## **Safety & Security**

**Proper segregation:**  
 Your cargo is marked and segregated from others.

**Documentation:**  
 Separate consignment note for your cargo.

**Insurance:**  
 Available for declared value.

**Tracking:**  
 Vehicle-level tracking (not individual package tracking).

## **Delivery Time**

* Standard: 3-7 days depending on distance

* Express: 1-3 days for select routes

## **Popular Routes**

* Mumbai to Delhi

* Ahmedabad to Kolkata

* Chennai to Bangalore

* Delhi to Mumbai

* Bangalore to Hyderabad

# ABOUT PAGE

## **Our Story**

We started in 1982 with a simple idea: move cargo reliably, track it completely, and keep clients informed.

43 years later, we're moving 96,000 shipments annually across India. We've grown from local transport to pan-India operations with plans for Dubai and Africa.

## **What Sets Us Apart**

**Real tracking, not updates**  
 Our GPS system tracks through driver phones and cell towers. You get automated reports every hour not when someone remembers to call you.

**Owned \+ Leased fleet**  
 75 owned vehicles and 650 leased vehicles give us flexibility. Need 50 trucks next week? We can make it happen.

**500 containers ready**  
 We own 500 containers in different sizes and types. GP, high cube, reefer, tank, flat rack whatever your cargo needs.

## **Our Approach**

We check container conditions before pickup. We provide bottle seals for your cargo. We verify everything at delivery and inform you immediately if there's an issue.

When you need escorts, special locks, or brand-new containers for high-value cargo—you get them. No upcharges, no negotiations.

## **Technology Integration**

We're building **DICE**, our end-to-end logistics platform. It handles orders, tracking, documentation, and billing with minimal human intervention. AI integration improves route planning and reduces delivery times.

## **Training Matters**

**Aamita** is our weekly training program where industry experts share real experiences. Our team learns from people who've handled ODC movements in monsoons, cleared customs in 2 hours, and managed port congestion.

Better training means better service for you.

## **Building Relationships**

We organize the **Nisha Cricket Team IPL Championship** every year. Clients join us for friendly matches. It's not about winning—it's about knowing the people who move your cargo.
